# Unmapped Existing Pages

This document lists existing physical pages in `src/app/(site)` that are not currently linked in the main navigation menu (`Header.tsx`). These pages are functional but "orphaned" from the primary user flow.

## 1. Insights & Resources
- **E-books Listing**: `/insights/ebooks` (Moved from /resources/ebooks)
- **Local SEO**: `/services/local-seo`

## 2. Orphaned Service Pages
These capability-specific pages exist but were excluded from the new condensed "Capabilities" menu categories.
- **Branding & Identity**: `/services/branding`
- **Consulting**: `/services/consulting`
- **E-commerce Scaling**: `/services/ecommerce-scaling`
- **UI/UX Design**: `/services/ui-ux`
- **Marketplace Optimization**: `/services/marketplace-optimization`
- **Ad Creatives**: `/services/ads-creative`

### Specialized Tech & Analytics Support Pages:
- **Google Analytics 4**: `/services/google-analytics-4`
- **Conversion Analytics**: `/services/conversion-analytics`
- **Marketing Dashboards**: `/services/marketing-dashboards`
- **Marketing Measurement**: `/services/marketing-measurement`
- **Social Analytics**: `/services/social-media-analytics`

## 3. General & Support Pages
- **FAQ**: `/faq`
- **Privacy Policy**: `/privacy`
- **Terms of Service**: `/terms`

---

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Redirects**: Legacy solution pages should be 301 redirected to the most relevant new "Capabilities" or "Approach" pages.
2. **Footer Linking**: Resources, FAQ, and Support pages should be clearly accessible in the website footer.
3. **Consolidation**: Small orphaned services could be merged into broader pages to reduce site sprawl.
